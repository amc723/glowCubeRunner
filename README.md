# glowCubeRunner

Nothing in this repo really works on its own. If you want to see the full project, feel free to shoot me an email at austin (dot) clifton23 (at) gmail.com.

A web build that uses these scripts can be viewed at:

Though I can't promise that will be the most up to date version of the game, or if the link will even still be up a year from now...
